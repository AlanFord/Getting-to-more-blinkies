# HAL Notes

Several options are available for the toolchain.

First, a commercial IDE such as KEIL can be used, albiet the free, hobbled version.

A relatively turnkey alternative is to use the SystemWorkbench, 
see http://www.openstm32.org/Importing%2Ba%2BSTCubeMX%2Bgenerated%2Bproject
If a generic board setup isn't used, a more detailed configuration can be generated
with the ST32CubeMX application for use with SystemWorkbench.

More broadly, a pretty generic, open source toolchain and IDE can be configured using Eclipse and a Gnu ARM toolchain.

But I'm going another direction.  There is now a free-to-use IDE from STMicro called Atollic TrueSTUDIO for STM32.
After installing in a Linux VM, install TrueSTUDIO.  That's it!  TrueSTUDIO comes with a full toochain and device files.

A new project was created using the "Embedded C Project" Project Type.  The Target was set to the
NUCLEO-F030R8 board (under the STM32F0 device category).  Debugging with ST-LINK is the
only option supported, so we are using that.

The generic files generated by the IDE for a new project include "main.c", which already includes
code for toggling the on-board LED.
```
/* -3- Toggle IOs in an infinite loop */
while (1)
{
HAL_GPIO_TogglePin(LED2_GPIO_PORT, LED2_PIN);
/* Insert delay 100 ms */
HAL_Delay(100);
}
```
The on-board user LED (LED2) is connected to connector CN5, pin 6, also known as Arduino
pin D13 and STM32 pin PA5.  For this work we will use CN5 pin 5 (Arduino pin D12 and
STM32 pin PA6).
