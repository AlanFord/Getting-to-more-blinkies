# Getting-to-more-blinkies
Getting to blinky on all of the micro controllers and single-board computers that I have.


Having collected a number of dev boards and single-board computers over the last couple of years, I realized that I hadn't completed a successful project on some of them.  So to refresh my memory and freshen my skills, this will be "getting to blinky" on all of my various boards (appologies to Contextual Electronics for repurposing the name).

Initially the goal will be to blink an LED.  The LED must be external to the board (using a canned routine to blink a
default on-board LED would be cheating).  This, by extension, may require a little bit of electronics to ensure that each 
board's current-handling capability isn't exceeded.
